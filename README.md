**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High-risk or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.
